# STANCE_Blueprint2021
This is STANCE, an Android Studio posture app made by team Ingenuity at the 2021 Blueprint hackathon!

There are a lot of folders here as a result of things being zipped up and sent around. But the most important files are in the folder:

STANCE_A_Posture_Application > app > src > main > java > ... > blueprint > tiltsensor

and

STANCE_A_Posture_Application > app > src > main > res

Note: it also runs best on a connected mobile device.

Enjoy!
